## Civic vs Gov Tech 

.center[<img src="./img/civicgovtech.png" height="400"/>]

---

## Open Source vs Proprietary

Many Civic & Gov Tech have a .red[*SaaS* business model], meaning that they sell the use of their software to professional customers (local gov, companies, associations..), often on a monthly basis. Those actors own the code of their software and aren't willing to open it, since they earn revenues through it.
Example : **Cap Collectif**

---

## Open Source vs Proprietary

On the contrary, some Civic Tech actors opt to "free" the code source - that is called **open source** - in order to let everyone reuse it, improve it (through a community) or customize it (add some features, change the design...).
Example : [**Decidim**](https://decidim.org/)

---

## Open Source vs Proprietary

According to you, how can those actors be sustainable in the long run ?

--

- Through a **commited community** that supports financially the projet (recurrent donations). Ex: [Captain Fact](https://captainfact.io/)

- Through **paid prestations** such as helping organizations to install their own version of the software + maintenance 

Some tensions may exist between proprietary and open source actors

## OpenDataSoft

A good exemple of a French Gov Tech that is successful and with a lucrative Saas business model : they develop and host open data platforms.

.center[<img src="./img/ods.png" height="250"/>]

In France, Open Data has become mandatory end of 2016 and most of public agencies (> 50 civil servants) and local authorities (> 3000 inhabitants) have to open their data by default (it's not an option). This legislative "constraint" created a clear business opportunity that OpenDataSoft managed to grasp substantially
